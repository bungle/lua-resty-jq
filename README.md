# lua-resty-jq

**lua-resty-jq** is a small LuaJIT FFI wrapper to [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)


## Hello World with lua-resty-jq

```lua
-- <example-input> from https://api.github.com/repos/stedolan/jq/commits?per_page=5
local jq = require "resty.jq".new()

jq:compile("[ .[] | {message: .commit.message, name: .commit.committer.name} ]")
local output = jq:filter(<example-input>)

print(output)

jq:teardown()
```

Running the above code will output (or similar):

```javascript
[
  {
    "message": "Add some missing code quoting to the manual",
    "name": "William Langford"
  },
  {
    "message": "Reduce allocation on string multiplication",
    "name": "William Langford"
  },
  {
    "message": "Fix multiple string multiplication",
    "name": "William Langford"
  },
  {
    "message": "Fix error handling in strftime",
    "name": "William Langford"
  },
  {
    "message": "Makefile: prepend srcdir to jq.1.prebuilt to fix out of source compilation",
    "name": "William Langford"
  }
]
```

## new

`syntax: jq, err = require("resty.jq").new()`

Allocates a `libjq` context.

## teardown

`syntax: jq:teardown()`

Destroys the `libjq` context, freeing resources.

## compile

`syntax: ok, err = jq:compile(program)`

Returns `true` if the program was compiled, otherwise `nil` and the error
`compilation failed`.

Note it is not currently possible to inspect details of the compilation error.
If in doubt, try your program in the CLI `jq`.

## filter

`syntax: res, err = jq:filter(data, options)`

Filters `data` using the previously compiled program. The `options` table can
contain flags which alter the behaviour of the filter, similar to a subset of
the CLI options to `jq`:

* `compact_output`: Returns output in a compact form without additional
  spacing, and with each JSON object on a single line. Defaults to `true`. Set
to `false` for "pretty" output.
* `raw_output`: Outputs as raw strings, not JSON quoted. Default is `false`.
* `join_output`: As `raw_output` but in addition does not output newline
  separators. Default is `false`.
* `ascii_output`: jq usually outputs non-ASCII Unicode codepoints as UTF-8,
  even if the input specified them as escape sequences (like "\u03bc"). Using
this option, you can force jq to produce pure ASCII output with every non-ASCII
character replaced with the equivalent escape sequence. Default is `false`.
* `sort_keys`: Output the fields of each object with the keys in sorted order.
  Default is `false`.
